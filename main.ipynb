It's traded the most active by far, but it's also a $3 stock, so open door, same shit. So, more real companies, NVIDIA and Pfizer, Brigetti retracing a bit of yesterday's move. Hopefully it will be down a lot today. UiPath, Starwood, Joby's up a little bit, MP's down, I think they raised or something. Taiwan Semi's up. Resolve AI is up, whatever that is.\",\n",

Maybe the market's seeing what I saw. Elevance down 4%, Rigetti down 3%.\",\n",

I don't know what the Joby business model is going to be. I don't know what the Joby business model is going to be.

Yeah, who told you to stay away from you and H? Me. I haven't looked in it too much at 27. I'm out of that business.\",\n",

Bare minimum of 11 sales. 900 million for PMO that's 1.4 billion and high margin revenue. What would 1.4 billion in high margin revenue go forward to private equity or someone like that?

Never call me a baggie, bro.\",\n",

It's a little pill bottle. And it's got Cuban links coming around, right? 24 karat, Cuban links. And inside the pill bottle, it doesn't have a label on it. It's like clear, right? It's like a glass, maybe like a hardened and tempered fiberglass pill bottle.\",\n",

       " \"I did that more out of necessity, you know, than anything else. Mack Baller crew was pretty rough guys, though, but I think Mack Baller has been disbanded due to snitching. Don't hold me on that, and no insults to my fellow sleaze. The slizzymes. That's what we would call each other, slime. I don't know why. Sleazy or slime? That was our, hey, what's up, sleaze? That would be an appropriate greeting. Why?\",\n",

I'd be like, yeah, yeah, what up, sliz? We riding on today. They'd be like, ah, that's my white boy. They would run around the room laughing like, ah, that's the white boy.\",\n",

Aren't you smart enough? Yeah, that culture's no good, man. That culture's no good. But we export a lot of black culture. Most of American culture comes from black culture, our music. For example, sports, clothing, fashion.\",\n",
       " \"So there's no racial quota, per se. But the urban community has carved out its own culture. And if you think about what is cool culture, you close your eyes and think cool. What do you think? You might think Kanye, Chris Brown, Jay-Z, DJ Khaled. You don't close your eyes, think cool, and think Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg. You think success, maybe. But you think, maybe think Rihanna. Who's the coolest person you can think of? And again, cool is just a word, but think of style, et cetera.\",\n",
       " \"So black culture is a major export within America. An export to other races, to be frank. And that is valuable. Hollywood, exactly. Comedy. So the culture of dealing drugs and killing each other and crime, that's not a culture. But what's funny is that we consume it, one. And two, we also exploit it. You know, the predominately white-owned companies love to put a black guy on TV and stereotype him or in a film and stereotype. Or on a rap song. You know, 50 Cent record is, I'm gonna kill you, a pump crack, blah, blah, blah.\",\n",
       " \"And the record label's like, sure, that sounds great. They write him a big check. But if he was rapping about, you know, thermodynamics, second law, entropy stays constant. They'd be like, what the fuck is this? Give me a gangster rapper like Tupac. You know, and then the guys try to out-gangster each other. You know, it's terrible. It's very pernicious. And you have media companies to blame, quite frankly. You can't blame the person trying to get rich. So in any event, I don't know what fixes it.\",\n",
       " \"But part of my point is why necessarily fix it? If black culture is the vanguard of American coolness and imitation, you know, then so be it. You know, sports as well, comedy as well. Although the Wu-Tang's Jizai, he actually does rap about thermodynamics and stuff like that. That's why he's Jizai, the genius. Yeah, ASPI is probably a good short. You know, guys on Wall Street, you know, my first friend on Wall Street is actually in the senior management of Sarepta. And, you know, we were 20-something. And he, you know, he loved rap music and we used to BS about it. There was another guy on Wall Street named Quinn.\",\n",

And, you know, you could still express your culture while still being, I mean, that guy's, you know, top, you know, Ivy League graduate and stuff like that. They both were. And it's still like, you know, you're celebrating that culture. Yeah, it's true. 50 Cent was a, I believe, solid state physics. Yeah. Yeah, Tupac was, they say Tupac was faking the whole thing. He was acting. Playing a role. Well, you know, enough about that. I mean, I think there's, you know. It's interesting in a way, but again, the idea of cleaning up culture is, I think, you know, to some extent, it's a bit insulting because there's a, there's something, there is something special about black culture, you know. But there's also, you know, something obviously toxic about it, too, in some cases, small parts of black culture, not all of it.\",\n",
       " \"But, you know, there's a reason we have Rick Ross, you know, as part of our intro. There's a reason we have, you know, some of the other films as part of our intro. It's cool shit. Thank you. We have a, yeah. There's, it's funny, people from, I was asking somebody who is from a totally different country, like really far out. And he was like, he knew all of the black cultures. Like, how do you know this stuff? How the hell do you know about young thug and rich homie Kwan and stuff like that? He's like, that's what we listen to at home. I don't even use Copilot in Excel. Yeah, I'm not, I'm certainly not woke, as you guys know, but I also do think that slavery had a long lasting impact, as well as civil rights. Those things take generations to work through.

Once it finds the San Francisco City government website, it will try to access the PDF files, so it has its own file system and everything.

If they don't give you access, what do you think that means? Exactly, stick man. Yeah, Marco Polo's right. I mean, if you were Super Bowl in the bull market, all these stocks are going like crazy. In 2000, you could have bought any stock that said dot com next to it, and you made 10X. But the problem is not many of those companies survived.

If you go through whatever channels you have to go to, I don't care what they are, you knock yourself out and D-Wave says, either ignores you or says, we will not give you access to this computer. What will that mean to you and your company? What will you think? If anything, you may not think nothing of it. By the way, the average person on Wall Street thinks D-Wave is a huge scam.

My friend has money in the company, a lot money, a lot more than you. And he said, can I get a, can I get a, you know, a log in to try it out? But it's, it's not that hard to imagine, okay, if they don't give you access, what would you think? I'll give you an example.

Well, my inference then is, well, she probably thinks that it doesn't look great, but she's just being nice to me. Right? So now I want you to put yourself in the same situation and say, if I went to D-Wave, which you did, you wrote, you made an email, and they never respond to you, what would, what inference would you have?

I'm not saying that's going to happen. I'm not even saying there's a 1% chance that's going to happen. But what I'm saying is if that happened, what would you feel? How would you feel about that? If they said, no, I'm not asking you if they said, no, will you try again? I'm not asking you if you said, if they said, no, or didn't respond to you, that you wouldn't raise hell.

Okay, so what does that mean though? You would have issues. What would the issues be? How would you feel? Because there's a lot of ways to interpret it, by the way. You don't have to necessarily interpret that as bearish. For example, a very reasonable way to interpret it would be they only want Fortune 500 companies. Totally reasonable, right? Google doesn't have their computer online. You can't use Google's The revenue is so low. You would think they want more clients, right? You could look at it either way.

The question is, would you think it's weird if they didn't want a new client? Well, what if they tell you, we just want big clients? We appreciate the investor-investee relationship we have, but quite frankly, Ms. Tess, you're not going to be a big client of ours. I know you might want to try it out, but are you really going to pay D-Wave $100,000? Don't you think that that's a reasonable answer?

We want MasterCard to use our product. We want Visa to use our product, right? I don't need investors to use the product. I mean, realistically, you're not going to use it. I mean, isn't that a good answer? Well, it's not so much the tea. Yeah. Okay, I see. So you do know somebody that's using it, but they're not a big player.

I can try that again. The Canadian person. And yeah, but they could still say, I mean, ma'am, you know, how much do you want to spend on our product? You use a lot of cloud products like this. Are you really going to spend millions? Why should we waste their time with you? Now again, IonQ gives you access, no questions asked. AWS, IBM, everybody else.

But what we've shown in that article is that they're actually very ready to ramp, yeah, a massive data center in Ohio that's going to get them. Got it.\",\n",
       " \"Talk about the H shape of the data center. Why was it an H shape to begin with? And then it sounded like they abandoned it in favor of just one big tent. What are the benefits of a tent? I want to know about data center shape broadly. Yeah, that sounds good. Who doesn't love a good data center shape? Look, the H, I don't know why it's an H. What's more interesting is the structure of the building. Okay.\",\n",
       " \"If you look at one physically, it's absolutely massive. It's close to a million square feet. It's just a monster. If you look at the structure, it's also three levels. So it's a very complex structure. Generally, what we've observed for satellite imagery is that it takes roughly two years to build, which, and I'm just talking about the first stone to actually getting the project built. So two years is a lot. Many people do that in a year or less.\",\n",
       " \"So yeah, substantial time to build. It was designed for very high efficiency. So they've been using a system with free air cooling. They can get the air from the outside. There's no air to water heat exchange. Basically, you get cold air from the outside. You just expel it, hot air. Super efficient. You can spray some water on it to make it even more efficient. The energy efficiency ratio is typically called the PUE.\",\n",
       " \"Maybe you've heard of that. Maybe not. Industry average is going to be 1.3, 1.4, which means that for every watt you allocate to servers, you have to spend another 30% or 40% of that power into cooling and power distribution losses and all of that. That ratio for meta was historically below 1.1. So they were actually the most energy efficient in the world running data centers. But the trade off is that these data centers took a long time to build and had a very low power density. So what happened is, first of all, at the end of 2022, Meta introduced the first massive\",\n",
       " \"design change. They completed it through the old age and built a more traditional data center design, single story, sort of a big rectangle, faster to build, maybe one year, maybe one or 15 quarters, something like that. Much faster to build, more denser, better suited for AI. It could handle liquid cooling. But what Meta thought, I think this is where the XAI story actually takes a big role. I think what Elon demonstrated when he set up that cluster in 122 days, he just shocked basically data center infrastructure leaders all around the world. He made everybody's life a lot harder because before it was like, well, if we do this really\",\n",
       " \"quickly, I'm going to need a year, year and a half. It's like, well, there's a new standard. I can do it in 120 days. Imagine you're the infrastructure leader at the hyperskater. You have experience developing gigawatts of capacity and you think you're the best in the world at doing that. And suddenly some guy comes out of nowhere and does it in like one quarter of the time. So I think many people were really shocked. I guess Zoc took it the other way and just was inspired by it. And basically that's where the tent steps in, which is let's make a data center in the\",\n",
       " \"shape that I can build the fastest so that, yeah, the only bottleneck is just finding some power and that's it. We were saying earlier there's a bull market in tents. Zoc needs tents. The XAI engineers need tents to sleep in. The XAI engineers are in tents in the office and then the XAI servers will be in tents too. Everything's temporary. I mean, is there something about the tent structure that's potentially like, okay, this is going to deteriorate faster?\",\n",
       " \"Like what are the drawbacks of moving faster? And then on the PUE question, when I hear a one gigawatt or five gigawatts that they're targeting, is that total power into the building or total power to the actual servers? Honestly, people generally throw, like there are both. In this case, based on our analysis, it's to the servers. So it's actually going to be slightly more in terms of gross utility power. Oftentimes, you see people quoting total power just to have a bigger number. Industry standard practices to quote IT power. Anyway, in this case, you're going to have one gigawatt of compute power by the end of 2026 in Ohio and then close to two gigawatts by the end of 2027 in Louisiana.\",\n",
       " \"That's compute power to the servers. So anyway, massive compute for LAMA. Is that a vanity metric? Is it a vanity metric to hit one gigawatt exactly? I mean, Stargate, you have on your chart 880 megawatts. Is 120 or 140 megawatts really going to be the difference between like an amazing superintelligence and the next best thing? Like, it feels like we had to cross this threshold and one gigawatt is like, it's a good headline. Yeah, it's a good headline. That's more of it.\",\n",
       " \"Like, it's not going to change much if you have 900 or a gigawatt. But the more the better, right? You still want to have more servers. Of course. Yeah, more is better. It does matter. To be clear, it's not going to change too much. It does matter. Sure. Yeah, it probably matters for recruiting too.\",\n",

One gigawatt factory or supercluster, that's a nice round number. It's great. Look, I've got a better one for you. A hundred billion dollars, right? Five hundred billion dollars, Stargate. Oh, yeah. That's something that's funny to me because actually the Louisiana project, which is two\",\n",
       " \"gigawatts, they said publicly it's a ten billion dollar data center project. But if you count it the same way as they count the Stargate project in Abilene, it could be like a hundred and fifty to two hundred billion dollars. Yeah, it's just, yeah, just big numbers. Okay. How, I don't know if you have a bunch of insights or clarity here, but how are places like Louisiana and Ohio reacting in order to attract these types of data center projects? Are they promising the hyperscalers in the labs, you know, we're going to massively expedite permitting process? Is there like deregulation happening at a local level?\",\n",
       " \"What can you say? Yeah, I think the piece of context is that since let's say the end of 2023 or maybe mid-2023, you have a frantic search for power happening in the U.S. and all around the world. And so we've made some numbers, we've aggregated some numbers. If you look at the pipeline, so there are different terms like data center interconnection load queue or pipeline. Basically if you aggregate all of the load requests that potential data centers have submitted to the grid, in the U.S. you're above 500 gigawatts. You're close to the actual peak load of the U.S., right? So what's happening is pretty insane.\",\n",
       " \"Those numbers are mostly fake. Like what it means is that people are searching for power all around the country and you actually have a massive competition all around the country to attract those projects. Because if you think about it this way, like, okay, 500 gigawatts of requests, but in the end by 2013 you're going to have maybe 100 gigawatts of growth, which is an insane amount already, but it means that just 20% of these projects are actually going to be real. So, yeah, there's definitely a lot of competition. So people are doing everything they can to get those projects. Tax breaks are generally today the most standard thing, accelerating permits, like reassuring hyperscalers that you will deliver on time, that you have top contractors, that you're\",\n",
       " \"going to expedite permits. Increasingly there's being sort of, yeah, enabling more on-site power solutions as well, like being more open to people burning natural gas on-site, all that kind of stuff. Health companies, utilities, and locations secure those big projects. I have a question about the shape of the superintelligence team at Metta. When you think about Metta properties, you think about Facebook, the blue app, you think about Instagram, you think about WhatsApp, and then Oculus and VR is like a separate thing, Quest. But I was toying with this idea that maybe the superintelligence team is more like the or the React team.\",\n",
