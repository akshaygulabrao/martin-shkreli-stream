Big news today is NVIDIA, they'll be selling their chip in China, so the stock's up 5%. It'll be interesting to see, this is a Q3 thing, although they are on the weird calendar, right, so this would make their quarter. Spiders up 40 bips. I don't know why the webcam does that. Good morning, Jake. Yes, NVIDIA's up 5%, most actively traded by a margin.\",\n",
       " \"Good morning, Hawk. Open Door's up 15%, so microcap. ProKidney's up 12%, vacillating quite a bit there. Archer Aviation, Big Bear, a lot of these stocks are meme stocks, basically. AMD's up 5%, MP is up 11%, weird company. AT&T down 50 bips. Haven't seen this one most actively traded in a long time. I wonder if there's news. We have so much news in Godel, it's insane. Way more than Bloomberg, and way more than any other service. Nobody else is even close, Trading View or Thinkorswim or anything like that, you're not going to get. If you're really, really trying to do research, you can't not have Godel at this point. Neo, Alibaba's up 6%. Arthur, you gotta not write stuff like that.\",\n",
       " \"You wrote stuff like that yesterday and we're going to ban you, man. I made my first trades when I was probably about 12 or 14. I started working on Wall Street when I was 16. So it's been a while. I don't know if Bob is up because the Chinese relationship is the longer bit. Tesla's up 70 bips, Trade Desk's up 14%, something must have happened there. Isn't that worth? A lot. It's a lot. Trade Desk is joining the S&P 500. Pride brokers are, you mean bankers?\",\n",
       " \"Bankers, you know, they take a small cut of every deal. Palantir's down 20 bips. Interestingly, none of the quantum stocks are in the most actively traded. That's a good sign for a short. Hocklow's up 1%. Oscar's really hot for some reason, down 2%. Intel's up 1%. A lot of news about some of their long-term roadmaps coming out. Beijing's up 8%. That's a lot.\",\n",
       " \"Oh, it also might be the China thing. Bitcoin's a weird one. I don't think you're missing anything. I think you can wait. CoreWee is rebounding a bit. Ampreus. Sounds like a drug company. If you're looking for stuff to trade, the Most List is really great, because the stuff is just guaranteed to kind of be moving at least up or down, so you can position yourself accordingly.\",\n",

Well, them and BlackRock at least are pretty big in ETFs. Nvidia's traded 3 billion bucks so far with AMD, far behind it. Tesla, Alibaba, Strategy. MP Materials, top five liquidity.\",\n",

The only thing that matters is what is the future of the stock hold for you. And that's up to you. I don't know what the future of Palantir holds. I will say that it's a great company. On Godel, you can just quickly type EM for earnings. This is my favorite function on both Bloomberg and Godel. And you can see that there's an expectation\",\n",
       " \"that Palantir earns like a dollar or so. So it's kind of an expensive stock in some ways, but it is also pretty expensive. It's going to be growing rapidly and that compounding of cash flow will catch up to the point where they'll be earning $4 a share in cash flow or something pretty soon. And the stock will probably go to $200 or $300. I don't know if the risk reward is getting thin or not, but it depends on what's going to happen. Which we just don't know.\",\n",
       " \"It could be the best opportunity to buy it in a long time. Work could be terrible. It could be at the top. It all depends on the company's performance going forward. Yeah, Hims is going up without an OVO. Pretty neat. Yeah, Palantir's looking a little shaky. Yeah. I don't know about Nebius. You know, playing the GPU infrastructure game is an interesting one. I have some friends in that space.\",\n",
       " \"I don't know. It's a tough one. Yeah, of course, if Palantir's growth slows, the stock will get crushed. But that's probably not what's going to happen. It depends per Ravlo, asks a good question. Do you think Susquehanna made a mistake? I don't think so. I think they're smart. I think they know the quantum stocks aren't worth anything. But I think that for them, selling billions of dollars of vol\",\n",
       " \"was a really great opportunity. So they have to have a long vol kind of hedge, which they got from the company for very little. So Susquehanna's probably going to make two or three billion on this trade, is my guess. I haven't looked at Centine. I don't really know Chamoth. Chamoth. I assume somebody will be introducing us soon. I saw the QUBT.\",\n",
